# RaspberryPIKA
This project uses Raspberry Pi and Kali to build a portable and usable handheld device.
I have always wanted a handheld Raspberry Pi. Most of the videos I found online did not have instructions or proper guidance.
I am focusing on the attainability and usability of the product, not just something that will sit in the back of my storage box.
I will link to the products that I am using and my justifications for choosing said products. 
If you are following this project, use it as a guide to modify the product to your needs.
I have a lot of the things laying around that I am using and I will also put links to other products that I would want to use if I already did not have it laying around.
I have always wanted a mini but functional keyboard for the vision of building something like this for years. I would like to give a shout-out to "arturo182" and "solderparty" for making a useful and functional keyboard.
Here is a list of all the products I am using.
Raspberry Pi Model 4B 8GB -$74.99

I was lucky enough to get it at my local microcenter in-person. I understand this is not an ideal situation for everyone, but please do not pay scalpers as I have taken over 6 months to slowly gather everything I am using for this unless you need it for work and it is urgent or will make a significant quality of life improvement even if you overpay for it.
MicroSD: I am using an old 32GB Sandisk MicroSD laying around, but feel free to use any card with a minimum of 32GB or more. As of writing this, I am ordering a Samsung 128GV microSD on sale for $9.99. Again, you do not need a card unless you have a specific need for storage. I know that I might need to use it as a SQL server occasionally for my school projects and don't want to switch cards all the time.

Now for the star of this show, it is this keyboard, made using a RP2040 and a Blackberry Q20 keyboard with an optical trackpad.
Honestly, I have always wanted a similar product to this but never knew where to start.
